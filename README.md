# Search-Algorithm-AI
The robot has been sent to a maze of size M x N, and the robot has to find 
the path from the Source (starting position) to the Goal (ending position). </br>
The robot allows to move in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right. In the 
maze, there are some obstacles. </br>

The student was asked to implement 5 search algorithms:
Breadth-first search, Uniform-cost search </br>
Iterative deepening search that uses depth-first tree search as a core 
component and avoids loops by checking a new node against the 
current path </br>
Greedy-best first search using the Manhattan distance as a heuristic.</br>
Graph-search A* uses the Manhattan distance as a heuristic.
